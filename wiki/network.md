# Common Protocols

## HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP and HTTPS)

- Foundation of data communication in the word wide web 
- Defines how data should e formatted and transmitted
- Based on a request-response model
- HTTP is a stateless protocol
    - each request and response pair is independent
    - results in a fast and efficient protocol

### HTTPS    
- HTTPS is the secure version 
    - encrypts data, using the secure socket layer or transport security layer
- is ensuring the data integritiy and authentication
- to implement https the site needs a certificate form trusted Certificate Authority
- Certificate authenticates the websites indentity and help to establishe a secure connection between client and server

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

- reliale, connection-oriented protocol
- ensures that all of the data is transmitted correclty 
- establishs connection, segmenting data into smaller packets, verifiying the receipt of packes and reordering the packets into their original sequence

## SSL / TLS

- cryptographic protocols designed to provide security and data integritiy

### SSL
- is depcrecated since 2015

### TLS
- newest Version is TLS 1.3
- encrpytion is achieved using a combination of cryptographic algorithms, key exchanges and digital certificates.
